# Frontend Mentor challenge - Base apparel coming soon section

<p>
  My version of Base apparel coming soon section for Frontend mentor challenge (https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/base-apparel-coming-soon-page-5d46b47f8db8a7063f9331a0).</p>
<p>For this challenge I used plain HTML and SASS. Component is responsive!</p>
<p>It was a fun, little project to make. :)</p>
